Hi, there! I'm Joshua Osburn! 

I'm a full-stack developer well-versed in many different web technologies, stacks, etc... I'm interested in creating RESTful APIs, network layer applications, and anything to do with home automation.

I'm currently working on learning React, CI/CD, and Time Complexity.
